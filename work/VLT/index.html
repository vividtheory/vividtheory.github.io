Underground parties, DJ nights, Nature Nocturne&hellip; the vivid light tubes are becoming a familiar sight around some circles of the Ottawa nightlife scene.  The combination of programmable LEDs, a dazzling cover material, and unique programming produce some captivating effects.  Just check out some of these <a href="https://vimeo.com/user51003445/videos">videos</a>.

<p>Physically, the vivid light tubes are not complicated.  Strips of programmable LED are enclosed in cylinders of Rowlux illusion film.  This film has a pattern refractive index which creates a unique light diffusion effect.<br />

The individually addressable LEDs are driven by Fadecandy boards, which can be connected to different controllers (usually a laptop or raspberry pi&hellip; depends on the application).</p>

<p>As is standard practice for Vivid Theory, the light tubes are almost always controlled by custom software.  While there exist many excellent applications for controlling LED installations,  doing things from scratch has a unique appeal for theorists and coders. For live VJing (e.g. at DJ nights), the current incarnation of software is being developed in C++ using OpenFrameworks. This provides almost limitless possibilites for interaction and engagement with the art (sound reactivity, Xbox kinect, leapmotion&hellip;).
