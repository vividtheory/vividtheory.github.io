<p>Exhibited at the <a href="http://glowfairfestival.ca/">2016 Ottawa Glowfair</a>, Impossible Illumination is a physical implementation of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle">Penrose Triangle</a> illusion.  If the segments have the same colour, the structure just looks like a plain triangle.  However, as the segments fade to different colours, it begins to look as though the three segments join at &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; 90 degree angles in 3D.  Unlike a 3D sculpture, here the illusion is created by colouring the different segments using programmable LEDs.  One might say that the physical structure is 2D, but the technology allows the illusion to extend into another dimension.

<p>The framing is created from stainless steel tracking, and LEDs are adhered to the frame boundaries.  The front/back faces are covered with a light-diffusing material to enable viewing from either direction. The use of steel tracking for the frame makes it light-weight and easy to transport.</p>

<p>The LEDs are controlled by two Fadecandy boards connected to a laptop.  The LED patterns are rendered using a custom C++ application developed using OpenFrameworks.</p>
