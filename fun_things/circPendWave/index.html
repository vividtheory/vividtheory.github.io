<p>A relatively straightforward gif created using Processing. Each individual dot oscillates sinusoidally along a fixed radial path. Adjacent dots have different oscillation frequencies, which results in interesting patterns.</p>

<p>This follows the mathematics of the &ldquo;pendulum wave&rdquo; phenomenon, which is explained very well in this <a href="http://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~arul/PH1010/AJP000778PendulumWaves2.pdf">paper</a>. The difference here is that the pendula have been arranged in a circle, rather than a straight line. As a bonus, staring at the centre of the image induces an illusion effect, where some of the dots appear to have dark centres.</p>
